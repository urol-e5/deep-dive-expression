Bismark report for: ../data/12-Ptuh-meth/POC-53-TP2_R1.fastp-trim.fq.gz and ../data/12-Ptuh-meth/POC-53-TP2_R2.fastp-trim.fq.gz (version: v0.24.0)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /home/shared/8TB_HDD_03/sr320/github/deep-dive-expression/F-Ptuh/data/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-1.0 -p 16 --reorder --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 500
Option '--non_directional' specified: alignments to all strands were being performed (OT, OB, CTOT, CTOB)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	100000
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	138
Mapping efficiency:	0.1% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	99559
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	303
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	0

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/GA/CT:	1	((converted) top strand)
GA/CT/CT:	62	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/CT/GA:	73	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
CT/GA/GA:	2	((converted) bottom strand)
