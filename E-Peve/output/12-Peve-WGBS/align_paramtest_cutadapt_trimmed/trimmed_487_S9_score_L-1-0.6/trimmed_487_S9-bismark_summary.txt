Bowtie 2 seems to be working fine (tested command 'bowtie2 --version' [2.5.2])
Output format is BAM (default)
Alignments will be written out in BAM format. Samtools found here: '/modules/uri_apps/software/SAMtools/1.14-GCC-11.2.0/bin/samtools'
Reference genome folder provided is ../data/	(absolute path is '/scratch3/workspace/zdellaert_uri_edu-deep_dive/deep-dive-expression/E-Peve/data/)'
FastQ format assumed (by default)
Processing sequences up to read no. 10000 from the input file
Attention: using more than 4 cores per alignment thread has been reported to have diminishing returns. If possible try to limit -p to a value of 4
Each Bowtie 2 instance is going to be run with 8 threads. Please monitor performance closely and tune down if necessary!

Input files to be analysed (in current folder '/scratch3/workspace/zdellaert_uri_edu-deep_dive/deep-dive-expression/E-Peve/code'):
../output/01.00-E-Peve-WGBS-trimming-cutadapt-FastQC-MultiQC/trimmed_487_S9_R1_001.fastq.gz
../output/01.00-E-Peve-WGBS-trimming-cutadapt-FastQC-MultiQC/trimmed_487_S9_R2_001.fastq.gz
Library was specified to be not strand-specific (non-directional), therefore alignments to all four possible bisulfite strands (OT, CTOT, OB and CTOB) will be reported
Output will be written into the directory: /scratch3/workspace/zdellaert_uri_edu-deep_dive/deep-dive-expression/E-Peve/output/08-Peve-WGBS/align_paramtest_cutadapt_trimmed/trimmed_487_S9_score_L-1-0.6/
Setting parallelization to single-threaded (default)

Summary of all aligner options:	-q --score-min L,-1,-0.6 -p 8 --reorder --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 500
Current working directory is: /scratch3/workspace/zdellaert_uri_edu-deep_dive/deep-dive-expression/E-Peve/code

Now reading in and storing sequence information of the genome specified in: /scratch3/workspace/zdellaert_uri_edu-deep_dive/deep-dive-expression/E-Peve/data/

Single-core mode: setting pid to 1
