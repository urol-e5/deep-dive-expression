	volume = {24},
	doi = {10.1101/gr.162503.113},
	abstract = {In bilaterians, which comprise most of extant animals, microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate the majority of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) via base-pairing of a short sequence (the miRNA "seed") to the target, subsequently promoting translational inhibition and transcript instability. In plants, many miRNAs guide endonucleolytic cleavage of highly complementary targets. Because little is known about miRNA function in nonbilaterian animals, we investigated the repertoire and biological activity of miRNAs in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, a representative of Cnidaria, the sister phylum of Bilateria. Our work uncovers scores of novel miRNAs in Nematostella, increasing the total miRNA gene count to 87. Yet only a handful are conserved in corals and hydras, suggesting that microRNA gene turnover in Cnidaria greatly exceeds that of other metazoan groups. We further show that Nematostella miRNAs frequently direct the cleavage of their mRNA targets via nearly perfect complementarity. This mode of action resembles that of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and plant miRNAs. It appears to be common in Cnidaria, as several of the miRNA target sites are conserved among distantly related anemone species, and we also detected miRNA-directed cleavage in Hydra. Unlike in bilaterians, Nematostella miRNAs are commonly coexpressed with their target transcripts. In light of these findings, we propose that post-transcriptional regulation by miRNAs functions differently in Cnidaria and Bilateria. The similar, siRNA-like mode of action of miRNAs in Cnidaria and plants suggests that this may be an ancestral state.},

While plant miRNAs match their targets with nearly-full complementarity leading to mRNA cleavage, miRNAs in most animals require only a short sequence called ‘seed’ to inhibit target translation. Recent findings showed that miRNAs in cnidarians, early-branching metazoans, act similarly to plant miRNAs, by exhibiting full complementarity and target cleavage; however, it remained unknown if seed- based regulation was possible in cnidarians. Here, we investigate the miRNA-target complementarity requirements for miRNA activity in the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis. We show that bilaterian-like complementarity of seed-only or seed and supplementary 3’ matches are insufficient for miRNA-mediated knockdown. Furthermore, miRNA-target mismatches in the cleavage site decrease knockdown efficiency. Finally, miRNA silencing of a target with three seed binding sites in the 3’ untranslated region that mimics typical miRNA targeting was repressed in zebrafish but not in Nematostella and Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus. Altogether, these results unravel striking similarities between plant and cnidarian miRNAs consolidating the evidence for common evolutionary origin of miRNAs in plants and animals.},

	abstract = {Disruption in DNA methylation processes can lead to alteration in gene expression and function that would ultimately result in malignant transformation. In this way, studies have shown that, in cancers, methylation-associated silencing inactivates tumor suppressor genes, as effectively as mutations. DNA methylation machinery is composed of several genes, including those with DNA methyltransferases activity, proteins that bind to methylated cytosine in the promoter region, and enzymes with demethylase activity. Based on a prominent body of evidence, DNA methylation machinery could be regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs) called epi-miRNAs. Numerous studies demonstrated that dysregulation in DNA methylation regulators like upstream epi-miRNAs is indispensable for carcinogenesis; consequently, the malignant capacity of these cells could be reversed by restoring of this regulatory system in cancer. Conceivably, recognition of these epi-miRNAs in cancer cells could not only reveal novel molecular entities in carcinogenesis, but also render promising targets for cancer therapy. In this review, at first, we have an overview of the methylation alteration in cancers, and the effect of this phenomenon in miRNAs expression and after that, we conduct an in-depth discussion about the regulation of DNA methylation regulators by epi-miRNAs in cancer cells.},

	abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. They are suggested to be involved in most biological processes of the cell primarily by targeting messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for cleavage or translational repression. Their binding to their target sites is mediated by the Argonaute (AGO) family of proteins. Thus, miRNA target prediction is pivotal for research and clinical applications. Moreover, transfer-RNA-derived fragments (tRFs) and other types of small RNAs have been found to be potent regulators of Ago-mediated gene expression. Their role in mRNA regulation is still to be fully elucidated, and advancements in the computational prediction of their targets are in their infancy. To shed light on these complex RNA–RNA interactions, the availability of good quality high-throughput data and reliable computational methods is of utmost importance. Even though the arsenal of computational approaches in the field has been enriched in the last decade, there is still a degree of discrepancy between the results they yield. This review offers an overview of the relevant advancements in the field of bioinformatics and machine learning and summarizes the key strategies utilized for small RNA target prediction. Furthermore, we report the recent development of high-throughput sequencing technologies, and explore the role of non-miRNA AGO driver sequences.},
