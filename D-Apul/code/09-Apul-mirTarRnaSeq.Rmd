This script will use the R package [mirTarRnaSeq](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.13/bioc/html/mirTarRnaSeq.html), which an be used for interactive mRNA miRNA sequencing statistical analysis, to assess coexpression between mRNAs and miRNAs. 

I will be using Part 1 of their workflow (see [vignette](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.13/bioc/vignettes/mirTarRnaSeq/inst/doc/mirTarRnaSeq.pdf)).

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(mirTarRnaSeq)
```

Using the test data as an initial pass to understand Part 1 of the package. Part 1
