To meet the conditions of a putative ceRNA, lncRNA must meet the
following conditions:

- putatively bind to an miRNA

- are negatively coexpressed with that miRNA, and

- show positive coexpression with the miRNA’s mRNA targets

To look for instances of ceRNA I’ll need to do the following:

First, from the network generated in
`33-Apul-miRNA-mRNA-lncRNA-network`, Find modules in which an miRNA
targets both mRNA and lncRNA, and in which the miRNA is *negatively*
coexpressed with the lncRNA(s). Then, from the lncRNA-mRNA PCC tables
generated in `21.1-Apul-mRNA-lncRNA-correlation-PCC`, check whether the
module’s lncRNA(s) are *positively* coexpressed with the module(s) mRNA.

Load files

``` bash
wget -O ../output/21.1-Apul-mRNA-lncRNA-correlation-PCC/Apul-PCC_mRNA_lncRNA.csv https://gannet.fish.washington.edu/kdurkin1/ravenbackups/deep-dive-expression/D-Apul/output/21.1-Apul-mRNA-lncRNA-correlation-PCC/Apul-PCC_mRNA_lncRNA.csv
```

``` r
edges <- read.csv("../output/33-Apul-miRNA-mRNA-lncRNA-network/edges_miRNA_mRNA_lncRNA_network_p0.05.csv") %>% dplyr::select(-X)

#  lncRNA_PCC <- read.csv("../output/21.1-Apul-mRNA-lncRNA-correlation-PCC/Apul-PCC_mRNA_lncRNA.csv")
# The above file is too big to read into R, apparently, so I'll have to work with it from the command line
```

First, I only have targets assigned regional labels (CDS, 3UTR, 5UTR, or
lncRNA), so assign the higher-level target type (mRNA or lncRNA)

``` r
# Assign target type
edges <- edges %>%
  mutate(target_type = ifelse(region %in% c("CDS", "3UTR", "5UTR"), "mRNA",
                       ifelse(region == "lncRNA", "lncRNA", NA)))
```

Find miRNA modules that involve at least \>=1 mRNA and \>=lncRNA

``` r
miRNAs_with_both <- edges %>%
  group_by(source) %>%
  summarise(has_mRNA = any(target_type == "mRNA"),
            has_lncRNA = any(target_type == "lncRNA")) %>%
  filter(has_mRNA & has_lncRNA) %>%
  pull(source)

length(miRNAs_with_both)
```

    ## [1] 36

``` r
length(unique(edges$source))
```

    ## [1] 39

36 of the 39 Apul miRNA involved in our network target at least one
miRNA and at least one lncRNA

From modules with mRNA and lncRNA, identify which lncRNA are
*negatively* coexpressed with their miRNA

``` r
neg_lncRNA_pairs <- edges %>%
  filter(source %in% miRNAs_with_both,
         target_type == "lncRNA",
         PCC_direction == -1)

nrow(neg_lncRNA_pairs)
```

    ## [1] 131

``` r
nrow(distinct(neg_lncRNA_pairs, target, source))
```

    ## [1] 120

``` r
length(unique(neg_lncRNA_pairs$target))
```

    ## [1] 118

There are 120 instances, involving 118 unique lncRNA, of lncRNA being
part of a module that includes mRNA AND being negatively expressed with
their targeting miRNA.

Note: the nrow(neg_lncRNA_pairs) returns 131 because the table includes
every *putative interaction* that meets requirements, which means if an
miRNA is predicted to bind in 2 different places on a single lncRNA,
there are two rows representing those interactions. So there are 131
**interactions**, among 120 **miRNA-lncRNA** pairs, which involve 118
**unique lncRNA** (so 2 miRNA-lncRNA pairs involve a lncRNA that is also
targeted by another miRNA(s))

Now I want to for each lncRNA that is *negatively correlated* with a
parent miRNA, check whether that same lncRNA is *positively correlated*
with **any mRNA targeted by the same miRNA.**

The lncRNA-mRNA PCC table is too large to load into R, so we’ll have to
work with it from the terminal.

First step is to save our list of negatively coexpressed lncRNA wnd
their targeting miRNA, so we can also access it from terminal

``` r
# Ensure we don't have any rows with multiple miRNA sources
#neg_lncRNA_pairs <- neg_lncRNA_pairs %>% separate_rows(source, sep = "; ")

neg_lncRNA_pairs %>%
  select(source, target) %>%   # source = miRNA, target = lncRNA
  distinct() %>%
  write.table("../output/33.1-Apul-ceRNA-network/neg_miRNA_lncRNA_pairs.csv", sep = ",", quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE, col.names = TRUE)
```

For every miRNA, get a list of its mRNA targets and save, so we can
access it from terminal

``` r
edges %>%
  filter(target_type == "mRNA") %>%
  select(source, target) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  write.table("../output/33.1-Apul-ceRNA-network/miRNA_mRNA_targets.csv", sep = ",", quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE, col.names = TRUE)
```

Now we can move to terminal work.

I want to, for each lncRNA that negatively correlates with its miRNA,
find the lncRNA-mRNA pairs that are positively correlated, *and* belong
to the same miRNA module

**Note:** The below code will take a while to finish, since it has to
repeatedly `grep` search the extremely-large lncRNA-mRNA PCC file.

``` bash
#!/bin/bash

cd ../output/33.1-Apul-ceRNA-network

    # Skip if no mRNAs found
    if [ -z "$mirna_targets" ]; then
        echo "  No mRNA targets found for $miRNA"
        continue
    fi

    # Extract all PCC entries for this lncRNA once
    grep -w "$lncRNA" "$lncRNA_mRNA_file" > "${lncRNA}_tmp.txt"

    # Skip if lncRNA not found in PCC file
    if [ ! -s "${lncRNA}_tmp.txt" ]; then
        echo "  No PCC entries found for $lncRNA"
        rm -f "${lncRNA}_tmp.txt"
        continue
    fi

    # For each mRNA, check if there’s a positive correlation
    for mRNA in $mirna_targets; do
        awk -F, -v OFS="\t" -v miRNA="$miRNA" -v lncRNA="$lncRNA" -v mRNA="$mRNA" '
        {
            gsub(/"/, "", $0)          # remove quotes
            if ($1 == mRNA && $2 == lncRNA && $3 > 0) {
                print miRNA, lncRNA, mRNA, $3, $4, $5
            }

Ok! We now have a file that shows sets of miRNA, lncRNA, and mRNA for
which:

- the lncRNA and mRNA are both putatively targeted by the miRNA

- the lncRNA is negatively coexpressed with the miRNA

- the lncRNA is positively coexpressed with the mRNA

That means these lncRNA are putatively functioning as ceRNA,
sequestering the miRNA to prevent them from acting on their mRNA
targets.

There are **117 putative ceRNA** included in this list, regulating 19
miRNA, forming a total of 3172 unique sets. Note that this table
currently contains duplicate miRNA-mRNA sets, because a new search was
made for each lncRNA. For example, say miRNA-1 had two negatively
coexpressed lncRNA, lncRNA-A and lncRNA-B, and 10 targeted mRNA. Say
lncRNA-A was positively coexpressed with 8 of those mRNA, and lncRNA-B
was positively coexpressed with 5. All 13 of those miRNA+lncRNA+mRNA
sets would be recorded in our ceRNA table.

Let’s summarize the ceRNA network:

``` r
miRNA_list <- ceRNA$miRNA %>% unique()

lncRNA_counts <- c()
mRNA_counts <- c()

for (i in 1:length(miRNA_list)) {
  lncRNA_counts[i] <- ceRNA %>% filter(miRNA==miRNA_list[i]) %>% dplyr::select(lncRNA) %>% unique() %>% nrow()
  mRNA_counts[i] <- ceRNA %>% filter(miRNA==miRNA_list[i]) %>% dplyr::select(mRNA) %>% unique() %>% nrow()
}

list <- data.frame(
  miRNA = miRNA_list,
  lncRNA_n = lncRNA_counts,
  mRNA_n = mRNA_counts
)

sum <- data.frame(
  lncRNA = c(mean(lncRNA_counts), median(lncRNA_counts), min(lncRNA_counts), max(lncRNA_counts)),
  mRNA = c(mean(mRNA_counts), median(mRNA_counts), min(mRNA_counts), max(mRNA_counts))
)
rownames(sum) <- c("mean", "median", "min", "max")

list
```

Generally, the ceRNA modules involve medians of 2 lncRNA and 7 mRNA.
Since there are a small number of modules with a *lot* of members
(e.g. the miR-100 module), median values are probably more
representative than the means.

Of the 19 miRNA putatively sequestered by ceRNA(s), 5 are previously
described (miR-2028, miR-2022, miR-100, miR-9425, miR-2050). 1 is
conserved among all three species (miR-100), and 1 between *A.pulchra*
and *P.evermanni* (apul-mir-novel-27, which matched peve-mir-novel-20,
peve-mir-novel-21, and peve-mir-novel22).
