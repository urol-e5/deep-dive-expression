This script will use topGO to analyze functional enrichment of miRNA targets for Apul 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(topGO)
library(tidyverse)
```

Set up gene2go file 
```{r}
# Read in Apul annotations
annot <- read.delim("../../D-Apul/output/02-Apul-reference-annotation/Apulcra-genome-mRNA-IDmapping-2024_12_12.tab")


```


## Functional enrichment of all targets, as predicted by miranda

TO DO

## Functional enrichment of targets negatively correlated with miRNAs (regardless of correlation significance)
