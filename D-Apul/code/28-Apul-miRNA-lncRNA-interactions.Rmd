This code will use Pearson's correlation coefficient to examine possible correlations between miRNA and lncRNA expression. This will then be compared to the miRanda interaction results of the miRNAs and lncRNAs. 

Read in miRNA data
```{r}
miRNA_counts <- read.delim("../../D-Apul/output/03.1-Apul-sRNA-summary/Apul_counts_miRNA_normalized.txt")
head(miRNA_counts)

# Remove sample150 column from mirna counts and remove any miRNAs with 0 for all samples 
miRNA_counts <- miRNA_counts %>%
  #select(-sample150) %>%
     mutate(Total = rowSums(.[, 1:5]))%>%
    filter(!Total==0)%>%
    dplyr::select(!Total)

# Rename gene count cols to match miRNA count cols
colnames(mRNA_counts) <- c("sample140", "sample145", "sample150", "sample173", "sample178")
```
