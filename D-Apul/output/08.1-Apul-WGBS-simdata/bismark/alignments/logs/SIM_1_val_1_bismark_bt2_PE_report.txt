Bismark report for: SIM_1_val_1.fq.gz and SIM_2_val_2.fq.gz (version: v0.24.0)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /work/pi_hputnam_uri_edu/deep-dive-expression/D-Apul/output/08-Apul-WGBS/work/65/373d788273796e1c07a7fdee2bf6a4/BismarkIndex/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.6 --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 500
Option '--non_directional' specified: alignments to all strands were being performed (OT, OB, CTOT, CTOB)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	1000000
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	811421
Mapping efficiency:	81.1% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	7
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	188572
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	0

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
