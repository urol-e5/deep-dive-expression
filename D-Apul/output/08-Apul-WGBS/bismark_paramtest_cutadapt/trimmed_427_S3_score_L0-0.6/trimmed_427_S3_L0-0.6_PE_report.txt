Bismark report for: ../output/01.00-D-Apul-WGBS-trimming-cutadapt-FastQC-MultiQC/trimmed_427_S3_R1_001.fastq.gz and ../output/01.00-D-Apul-WGBS-trimming-cutadapt-FastQC-MultiQC/trimmed_427_S3_R2_001.fastq.gz (version: v0.23.1)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /scratch3/workspace/zdellaert_uri_edu-deep_dive/deep-dive-expression/D-Apul/data/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.6 -p 8 --reorder --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 500
Option '--non_directional' specified: alignments to all strands were being performed (OT, OB, CTOT, CTOB)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	10000
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	4100
Mapping efficiency:	41.0% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	4067
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	1833
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	0

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/GA/CT:	1230	((converted) top strand)
GA/CT/CT:	801	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/CT/GA:	815	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
CT/GA/GA:	1254	((converted) bottom strand)
