==========================
Input filename: SIM_1.fastq.gz
Trimming mode: paired-end
Trim Galore version: 0.6.7
Cutadapt version: 3.4
Python version: could not detect
Number of cores used for trimming: 8
Quality Phred score cutoff: 20
Quality encoding type selected: ASCII+33
Unable to auto-detect most prominent adapter from the first specified file (count Nextera: 0, count smallRNA: 0, count Illumina: 0)
Defaulting to Illumina universal adapter ( AGATCGGAAGAGC ). Specify -a SEQUENCE to avoid this behavior).
Adapter sequence: 'AGATCGGAAGAGC' (Illumina TruSeq, Sanger iPCR; default (inconclusive auto-detection))
Maximum trimming error rate: 0.1 (default)
Minimum required adapter overlap (stringency): 1 bp
Minimum required sequence length for both reads before a sequence pair gets removed: 20 bp
All Read 1 sequences will be trimmed by 10 bp from their 5' end to avoid poor qualities or biases
All Read 2 sequences will be trimmed by 10 bp from their 5' end to avoid poor qualities or biases (e.g. M-bias for BS-Seq applications)
All Read 1 sequences will be trimmed by 10 bp from their 3' end to avoid poor qualities or biases
All Read 2 sequences will be trimmed by 10 bp from their 3' end to avoid poor qualities or biases
Running FastQC on the data once trimming has completed
Output file will be GZIP compressed
